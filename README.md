# ctfrank
### A library for getting team ranks on CTFs made with CTFd (and also display your team's ranks)

## Description

ctfrank.py is a library which uses Requests and BeautifulSoup to get all the teams from a [CTFd](https://github.com/isislab/CTFd) website.

You can then get each team's rank and stuff.

There's also a website showcasing our team which is easily editable.

## Installation

The ```app.py``` file contains a WSGI application in the ```app``` variable. Use your favourite WSGI server to run it.
